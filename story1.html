<h2>How It All Started</h2>

<P>
I still remember the first time we met.
It wasn’t dramatic. No background music. No grand moment.
Just two people standing in the same space, unaware that something had quietly started.</P>

<P>
We were polite.
A little awkward.
Careful with words. Careful with expressions.
</P>


<p>
I didn’t know you would become someone I talk to before I sleep.
I didn’t know you would become someone I look for in a crowded room.
I didn’t know you would slowly become part of my everyday life.

Back then, you were just someone I met.
Now, you’re someone I can’t imagine not meeting.

We didn’t know this would become us.
And maybe that’s what makes it beautiful.
