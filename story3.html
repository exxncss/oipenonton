<h2>Growing Together</h2>

<p>
  Not every chapter was easy.

There were misunderstandings.
There were days we felt distant — even when we were close.
There were nights filled with silence and overthinking.

Sometimes we were tired.
Not of each other.
But of trying to balance emotions, expectations, and reality.

Distance doesn’t always mean kilometers.
Sometimes it’s pride.
Sometimes it’s exhaustion.
Sometimes it’s just two people trying to process things differently.

There were moments when walking away might have been easier.
But we didn’t.

“Some memories don’t fade.”
And neither did the way we kept choosing to come back.

We stayed.
Not because it was always easy.
But because it mattered.

That’s when I knew —
this isn’t fragile love.
This is something that survives.

Not perfect. Not always easy.
