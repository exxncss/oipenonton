<h2>The Moment I Knew</h2>

<div class="split-layout">

  <div class="split-text">
    <p>
Three years.

Three years of learning.
Three years of growing.
Three years of becoming better — not separately, but together.

I’ve seen you at your happiest.
I’ve seen you at your most tired.
I’ve seen you doubt yourself.
And I’ve seen you become stronger than you realize.

I’m proud of you.
Not just for what you achieve,
but for who you are when no one is watching.

Thank you for staying.
Thank you for being patient with me.
Thank you for choosing us — even when it wasn’t easy.

And now…
in just three more months,
we won’t just be two people in a relationship.

We’ll be husband and wife.

A little scary.
A little overwhelming.
But mostly… exciting.

Because it won’t be about perfect days.
It will be about building a life.
A home.
A future.

Three months from now,
we’ll stand in front of everyone
and make a promise that we’ve already been practicing for years —
choosing each other.

Happy Birthday.

I hope this year brings you peace, clarity, courage, and happiness that feels safe.

And yes…
you’re still stuck with me.

This isn’t the end of our story.
It’s not even the climax.

It’s just another beginning.
And this time…
it’s forever.
