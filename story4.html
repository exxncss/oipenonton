<h2>Our Timeline</h2>

<div class="timeline">

  <div class="timeline-item">
    <span>Year 1</span>
    <p>
      Somewhere along the way,
we stopped trying to win arguments
and started trying to protect each other’s hearts.

We realized that love isn’t about never hurting —
it’s about being willing to fix what we hurt.

We could have chosen pride.
We could have chosen distance.
But we chose understanding.

We chose to sit down and talk.
We chose to calm down before reacting.
We chose to stay.

Not because we are perfect.
Not because we never fail.
But because what we have is worth protecting.

We’re still here.
Still choosing.
Still building.

And that means everything.
