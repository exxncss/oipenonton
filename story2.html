<h2>The Moment I Knew</h2>

<div class="split-layout">

  <div class="split-text">
    <p>
      We didn’t just fall in love.
We learned each other.

Your way of handling things.
My way of reacting to things.
Your calm.
My overthinking.

Sometimes we clashed.
Sometimes we misunderstood.
But somehow, we always tried to understand again.

We learned that being right isn’t always more important than being gentle.
We learned that patience is louder than ego.
We learned that love isn’t always loud — sometimes it’s just staying.

The small moments became my favorite ones.
Sitting next to you doing nothing.
Talking about random things.
Laughing after a silly argument.

We didn’t just grow older.
We grew softer.
We grew more aware.
We grew more intentional.

And somewhere along the way,
loving you became the most natural thing in my life.
    </p>
